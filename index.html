                <p>Being a two-year post grad with an unsatisfying job in a challenging job market, I was faced with the
                    inevitable question of what should be my next step. Knowing I was passionate about finding a career,
                    not
                    just a job, I did my due diligence of thinking through different options, but was unsure of how to
                    move
                    forward.
                </p>
                <p class="bolt-para"> Deciding to become a client of C2C was by far the best investment I could have
                    made in myself. From Day
                    1 of meeting the team, I was excited about the process and finally felt that I was making the right
                    and
                    positive moves to establish myself in a future career.</p>

                <p>Between the professionalism of the C2C team and the constant support and care offered from the
                    beginning, I felt myself maturing in my approach to not only networking, but being able to
                    understand
                    what goes into establishing a strong foundation for a career. I can say, without a doubt, that the
                    C2C
                    team was an essential component in my professional development and helping me navigate my way to a
                    more
                    fitting career.

                    Thank you Frank, Gretchen and Dick. I so enjoyed working with you all, and I can finally say that
                    I’m
                    confident with my career path!
